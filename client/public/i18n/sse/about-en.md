# About SSE

Social Systems Evidence is the world’s most comprehensive, continuously updated repository of syntheses of research evidence about the programs, services and products available in a broad range of government sectors and program areas (e.g., climate action, community and social services, economic development and growth, education, environmental conservation, education, housing and transportation) as well as the governance, financial and delivery arrangements within which these programs, services and products are provided, and the implementation strategies that can help to ensure that these programs, services and products get to those who need them. The content contained in Social Systems Evidence covers the Sustainable Development Goals, with the exceptions of the health part of goal 3 (which is already well covered by databases such as [ACCESSSS](https://www.accessss.org/) for clinical evidence, [Health Evidence](https://healthevidence.org/) for public health evidence, and [Health Systems Evidence](https://www.healthsystemsevidence.org/) for the governance, financial and delivery arrangements, and the implementation strategies that determine whether the right programs, services and products get to those who need them).

The types of syntheses in Social Systems Evidence include evidence briefs for policy, overviews of systematic reviews, systematic reviews, systematic reviews in progress (i.e. protocols for systematic reviews), and systematic reviews being planned (i.e. registered titles for systematic reviews). Social Systems Evidence also contains a continuously updated repository of economic evaluations in these same domains.

Documents included in Social Systems Evidence are identified through weekly electronic searches of online bibliographic databases (EBSCOhost, ProQuest and Web of Science) and through manual searches of the websites of high-volume producers of research syntheses relevant to social-system program and service areas (see acknowledgements below).

For all types of documents, Social Systems Evidence provides links to user-friendly summaries, scientific abstracts, and full-text reports (if applicable and when freely available). For each systematic review, Social Systems Evidence also provides an assessment of its methodological quality, and links to the studies contained in the review.

While SSE is free to use and does not require that users have an account, creating an account will allow you to view more than 20 search results, to save documents and searches, and to subscribe to email alerts, among other advanced features. You can create an account by clicking ‘Create account’ on the top banner (for desktop and laptop computers) or in the menu on far right of the banner (for mobile devices).

Social Systems Evidence can save social-system policymakers and stakeholders a great deal of time by helping them to rapidly identify: a synthesis of the best available research evidence on a given topic that has been prepared in a systematic and transparent way, how recently the search for studies was conducted, the quality of the synthesis, the countries in which the studies included in the synthesis were conducted, and the key findings from the synthesis. Social Systems Evidence can also help them to rapidly identify economic evaluations in these same domains.

Funding for the development and maintenance of Social Systems Evidence (and for the McMaster Optimal Aging Portal’s content on social aspects of aging that it supports) is provided by McMaster University through the Faculty of Health Sciences, the Labarge Optimal Aging Initiative, the McMaster Institute for Research on Aging, and the Provost’s Strategic Alignment Fund. Funding for the addition of content related to SDGs 7, 13-15 and support for marketing/communications is provided by the [Monash Sustainable Development Institute](https://www.monash.edu/sustainable-development).

Funding for mobility-related content on Social Systems Evidence is provided by the [Labarge Centre for Mobility in Aging](https://mira.mcmaster.ca/research/research-centre/centre-for-mobility) within the [McMaster Institute for Research on Aging](https://mira.mcmaster.ca/home) at McMaster University.

**Social Systems Evidence wishes to acknowledge the following sources of documents contained in Social Systems Evidence:** [Campbell Collaboration](https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/), [Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre)](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/), [International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie)](http://www.3ieimpact.org/), and [contributing members of the What Works Network in the United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-works-network), all of which are important sources of systematic reviews of social systems evidence.

**Social Systems Evidence also wishes to acknowledge the following groups that prepare the user-friendly summaries that we provide links to:** [Campbell Collaboration](https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/), [Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre)](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/), [Institute for Work and Health](https://www.iwh.on.ca/), [International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie)](http://www.3ieimpact.org/).

**Social Systems Evidence engages individuals with experience translating health- and social-system terms to translate the titles of included documents, which enables searching in all supported languages. Translators strive to represent the original title as accurately as possible, and are not attempting to change their meaning in any way during the translation process.**
