COVID-END Notes
----------------

2 databases

- All articles (master db) - all COVID articles are in the first spreadsheet indicated by RefId

- Only the ones in "inventory" (Inventory means the ones selected for best synthesis) are used for best synthesis - it's a column
  - Built on the decisions of the taxonomy

- Each article will have many best synthesis for each taxonomy item potentially!
  - This is the part you need to understand better and I believe we'll need another
    collection to track this information (i.e. best_synthesis) that relates the refId
    with the taxonomy as well as any other fields that are relevant

  - When searching we'll need another index to store best_synthesis articles
    and we'll also need to denote the main article with best Boolean indicating whether
    or not it has best synthesis.
