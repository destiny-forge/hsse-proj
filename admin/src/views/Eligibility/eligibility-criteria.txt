Note: 

1. If both coders indicate the article is not relevant
than it will drop off the list. Otherwise, it will show up in the discrepancy
conflict resolution interface for both parties.

2. Second question can be removed from SSE.

3. If the user indicates Yes to the first question, we'll load the full edit interface.
If the user selects NO for document type, we will clear / disable all editable fields on the form.
Leaving the save button.

4. Modify Article status
- options should be "In progress" | "Data entry complete"
- remove the other values and update the legend appropriately

5. Document Type in current system has context popup menu descriptions for each of the items
in the list. Our current implementation on the new system is a dropdown so we don't have the
context menus for coders. 

Optimization - change it to a radio button list, or provide context aware icon in the dropdown select list.


Relevance - boolean 
- Not relevant (if both coders indicate not relevant - has a refid - should be accessible in the system via search - edit Article details)
But it should not show up in any of the workflow lists for appraisal etc...
